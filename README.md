## dae * she/her mainly but it's whatever * 20
hobby + student, soon to be career artist and writer!! epic gamer, occasional roleplayer, eyeing up the prospect of making a game or two. and cosplay + sewing!
i suggest you take a peek at my strawpage for more in depth info + my outward links to socials and whatnot, but while you're here I'll say my biggest interests atm are:
+ splatoon
+ the house of the dead
+ high on life
+ the binding of isaac
+ courage the cowardly dog
+ vocaloid
+ junji ito
+ horror and surreal works like the works of yames, garage bad dream adventure, ENA, lacey games, dr. nowhere, your local breadman and more!!!
+ and... gulp... a handful of roblox games
  
i like anything that's a little weird or spooky and a little cute or colorful! i try my best to play the cards i'm given and i'm here for fun first and foremost!!
## for the record...
+ I don't have much of a set DNI - i block whoever makes me uncomfortable and i use my words when need be. that being said, i disapprove of "proship" or whatever slurry of terms there are for sentiments justifying the romantitization of abuse, (C)SA, and incest. that and bigotry, but that's more or less stating the obvious.
+ On Ponytown I'm on the 18+ server 99% of the time. Likewise, I don't want to interact with anyone below 18 on PT and I'd like you to respect that!! Some of my platforms are 16+ but others are 18+ (newgrounds, DA) for more graphic art
+ I'm not fond of much flirting, jokingly so or not, towards me. Hard no if we don't know eachother irl.
For more specific PT info...
+ my username is daedae!! <- with the exclamations!! but if you're here u probably know that
+  I usually people watch, but I'm ALSO usually up to chat! If I'm totally quiet I'm probably afk or offtab, though I try to use away if i'm stepping away and busy/dnd if i'm totally offtab doing something else
+ Sometimes I roleplay, though this is moreso with friends or in groups /party islands with more closed off settings! 
+ It's fine for people to cover/sit close but I may move out of the way to avoid cramming! but it's nothing that *bothers* me
+ my skins are also cool to take inspo from but please don't deliberatley copy anything 1 to 1 !!
